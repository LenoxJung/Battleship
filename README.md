# Battleship
This is a cool, original battleship game to play in the browser! Grab a friend, for 2 are needed to play. All the tiles start off blue to indicate the treacherous sea. Click on a tile to shoot a bomb. The power of the bomb makes the tile white, or maybe that's the nuclear fallout that's covering the water. Either way, that tile has been cleared. Hit a tile with where the enemy's ship lies and you'll see a pool of blood. Sink all your enemy's ships to win!
## Implementation
Only three files are needed in this implementation of battleship: battleship.js, index.html, and style.css. 
## Usage
Double click index.html from a file manager and select your favourite web browser. Enjoy the game!
